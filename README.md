# CodSoft-Python-projects
I completed 3 projects to practice my python skills. My projects entail using python to create a calculator, a rock, paper scissors game and a password generator.

#Key lessons
def: short for define. Used to define a function. In the calculator project i defined four functions: add, substract, define and multiply
Print(): displays whatever is included in the brackets
Return: used inside a function to specify the value that the function should provide as output
if:used to conditionally execute a block of code based on a specified condition
elif:can only be used if there is an if statement. It is used to specify another condition in addition to the if statement
else: used in conjuction with if. Specifies what should have in the event the if conditions are not met

#Arithmaric operators

Substraction -
