# CodSoft-Python-projects
I completed 3 projects to practice my Python skills:
1. calculator
2. rock, paper scissors game
3. password generator

Key coding skills were obtaining through completion of "Crash course on python" on coursera, which is part of the Google IT Automation with Python Professional Certificate.

#Key lessons
def: short for define. Used to define a function. In the calculator project i defined four functions: add, substract, define and multiply
Print(): displays whatever is included in the brackets
Return: used inside a function to specify the value that the function should provide as output
if:used to conditionally execute a block of code based on a specified condition
elif:can only be used if there is an if statement. It is used to specify another condition in addition to the if statement
else: used in conjuction with if. Specifies what should have in the event the if conditions are not met

#Arithmaric operators
Addition + 
Substraction -
Multiplication *
Division /
Exponent **

Overall i found the projects to be a good application of skills learned in the python course. 
Thank you Codsoft for the learning oppportunity!
